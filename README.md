# p1-start
Starter code for Project 1 in Spring 2020.

Any software dependencies for the project:
     This project depends on a few softwares to be able to function properly. One of these is access to a shell to be able to run the program. Another is to be able to access the files if they are not on the current machine. A VPN is required to be able to access all the files from another machine.

How to get it:
     To get a shell download MobaxTerm. This will alow you to use the programs created for this project. You will also need to download a VPN client to be able to access all the files from a differnt machine. 

How to run it:
     To run the program and recieve a graph and printout of the Young's modulus type the code "python plot.py raw-data/" following the '/' type the name of the file you wish to recieve data from.

An example of how to run the code, and what the user should expect:
     Example: "python plot.py raw-data/Aluminum_specimen_1". The readout should give you a graph of the Stress and Strain of the specimen with title and labled axies. The program will also give you a printout of the Young's Modulus of from the graph.

Two things I learned about bash, python, or git throughout this project:
     1. I learned how to effectively delete a set number of lines and how to move up and down a set number of lines in the vim editor. 
     2. One frequent problem I had early on was trying to get the graphs to appear when I ran the plot.py  program. With help I found out all I needed to do was use the plt.show() function to make the graphs appear.
